# Binance-Coins-Single-Pair
Using Binance API, I have developed a system which will only returns single pair coins i.e., the coins which are listed in binance and have only one pair. I have set that as btc, so the coins who have only one pair and i.e. with Btc. You can change this to any coin pair which you want.
Mostly this system will be used to predict pump coins as pump coins mostly have only one pair and that is with Btc.
